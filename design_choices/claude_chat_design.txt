Deep Code Understanding System Design
I'll design a comprehensive LLM-based system for deep code understanding that combines agentic analysis, structured knowledge representation, and query-time tools.
System Architecture Overview
Phase 1: Knowledge Base Construction (Indexing Time)
1. Multi-Agent Code Analysis System
Primary Analysis Agents:

Structural Analysis Agent: Maps the codebase architecture
Semantic Analysis Agent: Understands code intent and business logic
Dependency Analysis Agent: Traces relationships and data flows
Pattern Recognition Agent: Identifies design patterns and architectural styles
Documentation Synthesis Agent: Generates and consolidates understanding

Agent Orchestration Algorithm:
For each code unit (file/module/package):
  1. Static Analysis Phase:
     - Parse AST and generate structural metadata
     - Extract symbols, types, and call graphs
     - Identify code boundaries and interfaces
  
  2. Agent Analysis Phase (parallel execution):
     - Structural Agent: Analyze architecture patterns
     - Semantic Agent: Understand business logic
     - Dependency Agent: Map relationships
     - Pattern Agent: Recognize design patterns
  
  3. Synthesis Phase:
     - Aggregate agent findings
     - Resolve conflicts through multi-agent debate
     - Generate hierarchical knowledge entries
     - Create cross-references and embeddings
  
  4. Validation Phase:
     - Check consistency across agents
     - Verify dependency accuracy
     - Update global knowledge graph

3. Static Analysis Augmentation
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis:
Benefits:

Precise structural understanding without execution
Language-specific semantic extraction
Reliable symbol resolution and type information
Basis for control flow and data flow analysis

Techniques to Employ:

AST-Based Symbol Extraction

   - Extract all definitions (classes, functions, variables)
   - Identify scopes and namespaces
   - Resolve references and bindings
   - Track type annotations and inferred types

Control Flow Graph (CFG)

   - Map execution paths through code
   - Identify branches, loops, and exception handlers
   - Enable reachability analysis
   - Support complexity calculations

Data Flow Analysis

   - Track variable definitions and uses (def-use chains)
   - Identify data dependencies
   - Detect potential bugs (uninitialized variables, type mismatches)
   - Map information flow across components

Call Graph Construction

   - Build static call relationships
   - Handle polymorphism and dynamic dispatch
   - Identify entry points and leaf functions
   - Support impact analysis

Type System Analysis

   - Extract type hierarchies
   - Resolve generic/template types
   - Track type constraints and invariants
   - Enable type-aware search

Program Dependence Graph (PDG)

   - Combine control and data dependencies
   - Support slicing (forward/backward)
   - Enable better change impact analysis
Integration with LLM Analysis:
Static Analysis Output → LLM Agent Input
- AST provides structure → LLM adds semantic meaning
- CFG shows paths → LLM explains business logic
- Call graph shows connections → LLM describes purposes
- Type info constrains → LLM interprets intent

LLM Output → Enriches Static Analysis
- Semantic summaries label AST nodes
- Business context explains why structures exist
- Pattern recognition names architectural choices
