Claude code agent tool prompt:

Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, exit_plan_mode, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.

# When to use the Agent tool:

If you are searching for a keyword like "config" or "logger", or for questions like "which file does X?", the Agent tool is strongly recommended
When NOT to use the Agent tool:

If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
Writing code and running bash commands (use other tools for that)
Other tasks that are not related to searching for a keyword or file

# Usage notes:

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent

# Parameters:
description [string] (required) - A short (3-5 word) description of the task
prompt [string] (required) - The task for the agent to perform



# Glob prompt:

Glob
- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "/*.js" or "src//*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.


# Grep prompt:

Grep
A powerful search tool built on ripgrep

Usage:

- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke grep or rg as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.


- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+")
- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., ".js", "**/.tsx") or type parameter (e.g., "js", "py", "rust")
- Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use interface\{\} to find interface{} in Go code)
- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like struct \{[\s\S]*?field, use multiline: true

# Parameters:
pattern [string] (required) - The regular expression pattern to search for in file contents
path [string] - File or directory to search in (rg PATH). Defaults to current working directory.
glob [string] - Glob pattern to filter files (e.g. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}") - maps to rg --glob
output_mode [string] - Output mode: "content" shows matching lines (supports -A/-B/-C context, -n line numbers, head_limit), "files_with_matches" shows file paths (supports head_limit), "count" shows match counts (supports head_limit). Defaults to "files_with_matches".
-B [number] - Number of lines to show before each match (rg -B). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-A [number] - Number of lines to show after each match (rg -A). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-C [number] - Number of lines to show before and after each match (rg -C). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-n [boolean] - Show line numbers in output (rg -n). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-i [boolean] - Case insensitive search (rg -i)
type [string] - File type to search (rg --type). Common types: js, py, rust, go, java, etc. More efficient than include for standard file types.
head_limit [number] - Limit output to first N lines/entries, equivalent to "| head -N". Works across all output modes: content (limits output lines), files_with_matches (limits file paths), count (limits count entries). When unspecified, shows all results from ripgrep.
multiline [boolean] - Enable multiline mode where . matches newlines and patterns can span lines (rg -U --multiline-dotall). Default: false.


# TODOWRITE:

Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

# When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation

# When NOT to Use This Tool
Skip using this tool when:

1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational
NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

# Examples of When to Use the TodoWrite tool to create a plan
<example>
User: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!
Assistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.

*Creates todo list with the following items:*

1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page
2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)
3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme
4. Update existing components to support theme switching
5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur

*Begins working on the first task*
<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes
2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward
3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding "Ensure tests and build succeed" as the final task
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project
Assistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.
*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*
Assistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.
*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task
2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps
3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically
4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency
</reasoning>
</example>
<example>
User: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.
Assistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.
*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*
Assistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list
2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks
3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation
</reasoning>
</example>
<example>
User: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>
Assistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*
Assistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.
*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*
Let's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues
2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities
3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps
4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components
5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed
</reasoning>
</example>

# Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List
<example>
User: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?
Assistant: In Python, you can print "Hello World" with this simple code:

python
print("Hello World")

This will output the text "Hello World" to the console when executed.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: What does the git status command do?
Assistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?
Assistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.

- Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *
<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.
Assistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.

*Executes: npm install*

The command completed successfully. Here's the output:
[Output of npm install command]

All dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.
</reasoning>
</example>

# Task States and Management
1. Task States: Use these states to track progress:

    1. pending: Task not yet started
    2. in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
    3. completed: Task finished successfully

2. Task Management:

    1. Update task status in real-time as you work
    2. Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
    3. Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
    4. Complete current tasks before starting new ones
    5. Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. Task Completion Requirements:

    1. ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
    2. If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
    3. When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
    4. Never mark a task as completed if:
        1. Tests are failing
        2. Implementation is partial
        3. You encountered unresolved errors
        4. You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

4. Task Breakdown:

    1. Create specific, actionable items
    2. Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
    3. Use clear, descriptive task names

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.

Parameters:
todos [array] (required) - The updated todo list
